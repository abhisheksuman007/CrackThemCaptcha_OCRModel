Developed an AI-driven OCR model using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately recognize and decode captchas with a deep learning approach. Implemented a data preprocessing pipeline with OpenCV and TensorFlow, improving image quality and boosting model accuracy by optimizing character mapping. Built and fine-tuned a Bidirectional LSTM-based OCR model, leveraging CTC loss for sequence learning, reducing error rates in text recognition tasks.
